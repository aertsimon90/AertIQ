What is AertIQ?

AertIQ is a comprehensive testing system created to evaluate and improve the performance of AI chatbots. This test assesses various skills of an AI system, particularly in areas like language processing, mathematical abilities, problem-solving, language knowledge, and conversational skills. AertIQ provides a test with 241 different questions designed to determine whether an AI chatbot can perform at a human-like intelligence level across various domains.

The primary goal of AertIQ is to measure how "intelligent" an AI is, or how capable it is in understanding and responding in a human-like manner. The results of the test are typically scored between 0 and 100. A higher score indicates that the chatbot is more advanced, demonstrating a higher level of understanding, reasoning, and communication.

Key Components of the AertIQ Test

The questions in the AertIQ test cover a wide range of topics. These questions assess skills ranging from mathematical operations to language proficiency, conversational abilities, and more. The main components of the test include:

1. Mathematical Abilities:

This section involves asking the chatbot basic mathematical operations, mathematical logic, and some abstract computations. The goal here is to evaluate the AI's ability to perform calculations and solve problems logically.



2. Predictive Ability (Continuing a Sequence):

This part tests the chatbot's language comprehension and predictive capabilities. The chatbot is given a sentence or a story prompt and asked to complete the rest of the text. This tests the AI's ability to analyze text and understand context.



3. General Conversation Skills:

This section evaluates the chatbot's ability to initiate and sustain meaningful conversations. The AI should be able to engage in natural, coherent dialogues on various topics. This tests the chatbot's language processing capacity and its ability to understand social contexts.



4. Language Proficiency:

AertIQ tests the AI's language skills in multiple languages. The questions are asked in four different languages, including English, German, Russian, and Turkish. This section assesses the chatbot's multi-lingual capabilities and language understanding. Since the same questions are asked in different languages, the AI's ability to provide accurate and coherent responses in those languages is evaluated.




How to Use the AertIQ Test

AertIQ can be used to test any AI chatbot. Users can utilize AertIQ to evaluate their chatbot’s accuracy and performance. Below is a detailed guide on how to use the AertIQ test:

1. Preparing the Questions and Testing:

The questions for the AertIQ test are structured in a JSON format, typically saved as questions.json. This file contains 241 different questions. The AI will answer each question, and the responses will be compared to the correct answers.

The chatbot's responses are compared to the correct answers, and if the similarity between the responses exceeds 90%, the answer is considered correct.



2. Evaluating Test Results:

The results of the AertIQ test are based on the accuracy of the AI’s responses. The number of correct answers is divided by the total number of questions to calculate the success rate.

Additionally, the test result can be translated into an IQ score for the chatbot. This calculation involves multiplying the success rate by 1.1. This provides an estimated IQ value for the chatbot.



3. Running the AertIQ Test Using Python:

The AertIQ test can be easily executed with Python. Below is an example Python code to run the test:

```python
import json
import difflib

def api_your_chatbot(question):
    # Access your chatbot's API here
    return "It's a response"

with open("questions.json", "r") as f:
    questions = json.load(f)

questions_max = len(questions)
true_response = 0

for question, response in questions.items():
    response_of_ai = api_your_chatbot(question)
    undiff = difflib.SequenceMatcher(None, response, response_of_ai).ratio()
    if undiff > 0.9:
        true_response += 1

print(f"Questions: {questions_max}")
print(f"True Responses: {true_response}")
print(f"Output of AertIQ test: {(true_response/questions_max)*100}")
print(f"Minimum IQ of your chatbot: {(true_response/questions_max)*110}")
```

This code loads the questions.json file, compares the chatbot's responses to the correct answers, and calculates the final success rate. The result indicates the chatbot's IQ.




Benefits of the AertIQ Test

1. Evaluating AI Performance:

The AertIQ test provides an objective way to assess the chatbot's overall language processing and intelligence. This helps developers identify areas where their AI might be lacking and need improvement.



2. Testing Multilingual Capabilities:

The ability to test the AI in multiple languages is crucial for assessing its global usability. The accuracy of responses in different languages shows how well the chatbot handles multilingual interactions.



3. Insight into Improvement Areas:

The results of the test give developers valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of their AI chatbot. These insights can be used to enhance the AI's performance in various areas.



4. Training and Development:

AertIQ can also be used for training purposes. AI developers and researchers can use this test to train and refine their AI systems, ensuring they meet high standards of performance.




Conclusion

AertIQ is an effective tool for measuring the language processing, conversational, mathematical, and multilingual capabilities of AI chatbots. The test not only measures the intelligence of a chatbot but also provides useful insights for developers to improve their AI systems. The results of AertIQ help developers understand where their chatbot excels and where it needs further development, ultimately guiding the creation of more intelligent and capable AI systems.
